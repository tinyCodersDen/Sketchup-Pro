# Sketchup-Pro
Simple sketching app using pygame! This is the first version of this app. Just download main.py, open up a terminal, and enter the following command:

```python
python3 main.py
```

We are yet to release sketchup pro 2.0! It is on an alpha release and it will likely get released sooner.<br>
Note: We are planning to use Javascript/Typescript to make our application faster and more efficient. Pygame release will be marked as "inactive".
